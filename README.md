# Test-Driven Development Exercises
A collection of exercises for practicing TDD and refactoring

## Exercise 1

### Scenario

You are trying to coach a developer who has a working knowledge of JUnit but very little 
experience with TDD and refactoring. The developer is willing to learn about TDD but is 
also skeptical about its effectiveness. He thinks that all the examples he has seen are
too simple or contrived and that the demonstrations he has seen lacked authenticity and
came across as canned and scripted to make TDD appear easy and effective. 

None of the previous attempts he has made to do TDD with real-world code went well, 
making him even more skeptical that the technique actual works. He's willing to accept
that he's missed something but wants you to show him what exactly he's not getting about
TDD.

He issues a challenge to you: Demonstrate TDD on code that you've never seen before and 
gives you some simple but non-trivial code that is supposed to be a good exercise for 
learning TDD and refactoring. If you can show him how to use TDD to work through this 
code, refactor it, and make some design improvements/enhancements to it, he's willing to
give TDD some serious consideration.

Some things you might want to discuss/demonstrate:

* Reasons for changing code
* Code smells
* Reasons for refactoring
* The role of unit tests in refactoring and TDD
